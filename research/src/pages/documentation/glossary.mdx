# Open UI Jargon

## Definitions

- Specification: a document that describes how a component should work.
- Anatomy: The parts that make up the control/component (e.g. \<popup\>)
- States: The various states of the control/component that this can be in (e.g. \<popup state=\"open\"\>)
- Behaviors: The implications of state changes on various parts of the anatomy (eg: aria, rendering, state changes)
- Graduated Specification: a specification that has been moved to a standards body, like WHATWG, or the W3C.

The Web Platform Contribution Guide also has a jargon glossary which might help demistify some concepts: https://wpc.guide/glossary/.
